% function that computes the relative translation of a universal XZ joint, which, from parent frame, rotates first along X axis by \alpha, then rotates along the local Z axis by \gamma
%   input: q = [\alpha; \gamma] where n is the quaternion

function xlt = universal_XZ_translation(~)

    xlt = zeros(3,1);
