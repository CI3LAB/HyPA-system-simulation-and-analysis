% function that computes the relative translation of a universal XY joint, which, from parent frame, rotates first along X axis by \alpha, then rotates along the local Y axis by \beta
%   input: q = [\alpha; \beta] where n is the quaternion

function xlt = universal_XY_translation(~)

    xlt = zeros(3,1);
